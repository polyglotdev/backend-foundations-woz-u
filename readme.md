## Why Back-end??
Back-End development, or server side development, is a software development focused on communication between the outside world and the database. Actions, such as signing into a social media account, streaming music, or seaching for a quert in a search engine rely on the back-end of an application to respond to the different requests. The Back-End consists of a server, that both recieves and responds to requests through code and a database to store data(see figure 1-1 below). This is contrasted with the front-end, in which the user interacts with, and relies on the Back-End to power the application.
